### pacman_map_correctness
  This file helps you to test your own pacman map to see wether it is valid or not :)
  It gets the json file of map from you and returns the result of correctness
  Below is how you can run it:
  
  ``
  python pacman_map_correctness map_address
  ``

  where map_address is actually where your json file is ...
